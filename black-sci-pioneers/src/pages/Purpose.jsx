          This API pays tribute to remarkable black scientists, both historical
          and contemporary, who have played pivotal roles in advancing knowledge
          and human understanding. It stands as a tribute not only to their
          achievements but to the entire black community's contributions. In a
          world marked by diversity, unity is our strength. Special thanks to
          Wikipedia, the wellspring of this invaluable information.
